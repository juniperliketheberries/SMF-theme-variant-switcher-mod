# Theme Variant Switcher for Simple Machine Forum

## Description

Theme Variant Switcher adds functionality to toggle between theme variants for a currently active theme, specifically for use with 'light' and 'dark' mode themes.

This mod expects that a theme will provide exactly two variants, and injects a menu item for toggling the current theme variant. 

Theme variants can already easily be modified by users from the **Look and Feel** profile menu.

This mod works whether or not javascript is enabled on the client.

The requested change is persistent; it works by updating the user's requested theme on their profile. Users must be allowed to select themes.

Note that menus are cached; you may need to clear cache for this mod to take effect.
